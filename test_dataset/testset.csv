"QUESTION29)This question refers to the following information.
 I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
 A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
 ""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
 And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
 On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
 When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
 The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
 But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
 In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
 There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
 Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
 The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
 It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
 They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
 ""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
 Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
 We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
 The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
 The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
 But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
 I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
 It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
 And live with the neighbors next door.
 But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""
