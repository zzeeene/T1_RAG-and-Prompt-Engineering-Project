# NLP RAG & Prompt Engineering Project

## Description

This project is part of the **24-2 Natural Language Processing** course and focuses on building a question-answering system enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced prompt engineering techniques. The system is designed to improve the performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) provided by [Upstage (Solar)](https://www.upstage.ai).

> The methods used in this project include:
>
>> - **UpstageEmbeddings** for contextual understanding.
>>
>> - Web crawling to gather domain-specific knowledge using **BeautifulSoup**
>>   
>> - **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** for efficient text segmentation and preprocessing.
>>   
>> - Keyword extraction using **NLTK** and **TfidfVectorizer**.
>>   
>> - Document retrieval via the **Wikipedia API**.
>>   
>> - **Prompt engineering** to improve the model's ability to understand and answer questions.
